1.What is Virtual environment ?
virtualenv is a tool to create isolated Python environments
It creates an environment that has its own installation directories, that doesn’t share libraries with other
virtualenv environments (and optionally doesn’t access the globally installed libraries either).

An IP address identifies a host machine on the Internet.
-An IP port will identify a specific application running on an Internet host
machine.
-A port is identified by a number, the port number.
-The number of ports is not functionally limited, in contrast to serial
communications where only 4 ports are allowed.
-There are some port numbers which are dedicated for specific
applications


The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed,
collaborative, hypermedia information systems. This is the foundation for data communication for the World Wide Web (i.e. internet)


 Protocols
-Define the rules that govern the communications between two
computers connected to the network.
-Roles: addressing and routing of messages, error detection and
recovery, sequence and flow controls etc.
-A protocol specification consists of the syntax, which defines the kinds
and formats of the messages exchanged, and the semantic, which
specifies the action taken by each entity when specific events occur.
Example: HTTP protocol for communication between web browsers
and servers.
